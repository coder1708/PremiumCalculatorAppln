# PremiumCalculatorAppln
# Not provided node_modules file since size is quite big.
# Implemented Premium Calculation logic on app.component.html & app.component.ts file.
# User enters all required fields then on occupation dropdown change you will get respective premium calculation.
# If User makes Age field empty then Occupation dropdown reset to "Select Occupation" & Premium Calculation field will be hidden. 
# Also, if user makes Death - Sum Insured field empty then Occupation dropdown reset to "Select Occupation" & Premium Calculation field will be hidden. 
# I have used Death - Sum Insured field value as Death Cover amount which is used for Monthly Premium Amount Calculation.
# Showing Death Premium Amount Calculation value in standard currency format i.e ($) currency.
# Death - Sum Insured(in $) input is also in standard currency format.
# Added Unit Test file app.component.spec.ts for checking the controls.
